# Expanding-Cards
Expanding Cards Project (replicating HTML/CSS/JS code for practice, with notes in comments)

This is a practice project from the Udemy class 50 Projects in 50 Days. I am utilizing this class to play with fundamental HTML, CSS and JS codes to reinforce what I am learning in my TOS courses. I am following along with the video lecture, replicating the code from the video, adding my own notes in the file to study later. 

These will mostly be used for reference to understand bits and pieces of code as I go along. I did not write this project myself.
