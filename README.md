# Expanding-Cards
Expanding Cards Project (replicating HTML/CSS/JS code for practice, with notes in comments)

This is a practice project from the Udemy class 50 Projects in 50 Days. I am utilizing this class to play with fundamental HTML, CSS and JS codes to reinforce what I am learning in my TOS courses. I am following along with the video lecture, replicating the code from the video, adding my own notes in the file to study later. 

These will mostly be used for reference to understand bits and pieces of code as I go along. I did not write this project myself. 

Some takeaways so far (I've completed the HTML and CSS portion of this project):
1. vh/vw (viewpoint height/width)= unit of measurement in CSS, which means % of your web browser height/width, so 100vh = entire height of browser
2. overflow: hidden; = scroll bar is hidden
3. border-radius of a .panel means how much "roundedness" you want (vs. square)
4. margin - distance between two things
5. you have .panel (the picture) and .panel h3 (the text on the picture), the text can be manipulated via directional terms/pixels 
6. @media (something I'm still learning) - any styles in that section will only take effect if a particular variable occurs (ex. max-width 480px)
7. .panel:nth-of-type(x) - used in conjunction with @media, to say what happens if the above critera is met

Basically, I learned about viewpoint height/width (which is useful), how to hide the scroll bar, about creating "roundness" of boxes and margins between objects

** Will update once I get into JS with the JS portion of the project **
